## Deep Interest Network for Click-Through Rate Prediction<br/>Deep Interest Evolution Network for Click-Through Rate Prediction

TensorFlow 2.0 version of DIN [zhougr1993](https://github.com/zhougr1993/DeepInterestNetwork) and [mouna99](https://github.com/mouna99/dien) code.  
This code performs similarly to the paper on ml-20 and amazon datasets.  
You can modify the ```model``` called in ```main.py``` and then utilize a model such as Base, DIN, DIEN.  

Requirements  
* python 3.6
* tensorflow 2.0

Run ```python main.py```

additionally, add Transformer model in the recommendaiton model
